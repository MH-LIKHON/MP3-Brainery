### **Steps for Deployment on Heroku**

#### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
To begin, I **cloned the project repository** to my local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MH-LIKHON/MP3-Brainery.git
```

#### **2️⃣ Navigate to the Project Directory**
```bash
cd MP3-Brainery
```

#### **3️⃣ Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional for Local Development)**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

#### **4️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **5️⃣ Deploying to Heroku**
This project uses **GitHub Actions** to **automatically deploy to Heroku** whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

##### **🔹 Steps to Set Up Deployment:**
1. **Connected GitHub Repository to Heroku**:
   - Created a new Heroku app using:
     ```bash
     heroku create mp3-brainery
     ```
   - Set up GitHub Actions to automatically deploy changes.

2. **Stored Environment Variables in Heroku**:
   - Added `MONGO_URI` and `SECRET_KEY` to **Heroku Config Vars**:
     ```bash
     heroku config:set MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-connection-string"
     heroku config:set SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
     ```

3. **Configured GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment**:
   - Created a GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to automate deployment.
   - Secrets like `HEROKU_API_KEY` were stored in **GitHub Secrets**.

4. **Pushed Changes to Trigger Deployment**:
   - After making changes, I committed and pushed them:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Deploying updated version to Heroku"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - **GitHub Actions automatically deployed the updated version to Heroku**.

MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```
✅ **Note:** The `.env` file is ignored in `.gitignore` for security.

#### **6️⃣ Run the Flask Application**
```bash
python3 app.py
```

#### **7️⃣ Open the Project in Your Browser**
- Once the server is running, open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in a web browser.

### **🎯 Why Use Heroku Instead of GitHub Pages?**
✅ **Supports Full-Stack Apps** - Unlike GitHub Pages (static hosting), Heroku can host **Flask, Django, and databases**.  
✅ **Continuous Deployment** - GitHub Actions ensures **automatic deployment on every push**.  
✅ **Environment Variable Management** - Heroku securely stores **MongoDB credentials and API keys**.  
✅ **Free Tier Available** - Ideal for small projects with free database hosting options.

### **✅ Next Steps**
📌 **Commit and push the updated README file**:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated Deployment section for Heroku"
git push origin main
```
🎉 **Now your README is accurate!** Let me know if you need any edits! 🚀🔥
